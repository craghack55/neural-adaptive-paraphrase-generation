	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm for short-text (Chinese) classification applied to a deep learning architecture. This topic thus belongs to a cross research area between active learning and deep learning. One of the bottlenecks of deeplearning for classification is that it relies on large number of labeled samples, which is expensive and time consuming to obtain. Active learning aims to overcome this disadvantage through asking the most useful queries in the form of unlabeled samples to belabeled. In other words, active learning intends to achieve precise classification accuracy using as few labeled samples as possible. Such ideas have been investigated in conventional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) for imageclassification, and in deep neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep belief networks (DBN) for image classification. Yet the research on combining active learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for short-text classificationis rare. We demonstrate results for short-text classification on datasets from Zhuiyi Inc. Importantly, to achieve better classification accuracy with less computational overhead,the proposed algorithm shows large reductions in the number of labeled training samples compared to random sampling. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is a little bit better than the conventional sampling method, uncertainty sampling. The proposed activelearning algorithm dramatically decreases the amount of labeled samples without significantly influencing the test classification accuracy of the original RNNs classifier, trainedon the whole data set. In some cases, the proposed algorithm even achieves better classification accuracy than the original RNNs classifier. },

	Abstract = {

An obstacle to research in automatic paraphrase identification and generation is the lack of large-scale, publiclyavailable labeled corpora of sentential paraphrases. This paper describes the creation of the recently-released MicrosoftResearch Paraphrase Corpus, which contains 5801 sentence pairs, each hand-labeled with a binary judgment as to whether the pair constitutes a paraphrase. The corpus was created using heuristic extraction techniques in conjunction with an SVM-based classifier to select likely sentence-level paraphrases from a large corpus of topicclustered news data. These pairs were then submitted to human judges, who confirmed that 67% were in fact semantically equivalent. In addition to describing the corpus itself, we explore a number of issues that arose in defining guidelines for the human raters.

	Abstract = { In this article, we demonstrate the impact of interactive machine learning: we develop biomedical entity recognition dataset using a human-into-the-loop approach. In contrary to classical machine learning, human-in-the-loop approaches do not operate on predefined training or test sets, but assume that human input regarding system improvement is supplied iteratively. Here, during annotation, a machine learning model is built on previous annotations and used to propose labels for subsequent annotation. To demonstrate that such interactive and iterative annotation speeds up the development of quality dataset annotation, we conduct three experiments. In the first experiment, we carry out an iterative annotation experimental simulation and show that only a handful of medical abstracts need to be annotated to produce suggestions that increase annotation speed. In the second experiment, clinical doctors have conducted a case study in annotating medical terms documents relevant for their research. The third experiment explores the annotation of semantic relations with relation instance learning across documents. The experiments validate our method qualitatively and quantitatively, and give rise to a more personalized, responsive information extraction technology.},
